"""Local draft; standalone card candidate is separate from the USB listing.

The original runtime adapter is compiled by build_runtime.py. Presentation
and local catalogue metadata live in local-module.json. The private card builder
does not register a public card recipe. Local card installation uses the standard
USB base plus saved sets; build_resident.py remains the historical C15 adapter.
