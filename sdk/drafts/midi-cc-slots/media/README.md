# Midi Mode 2 — emulator walkthrough

Actual firmware LCD pixels from the MKII emulator, captured on 24 October 2026. The naming images show 0.0.7-experimental. The earlier CC walkthrough retains its 0.0.4-experimental capture identity. They are not physical-device photographs or hardware qualification.

## Name a MIDI track

![MIDI NOTE SETUP with NAME/PUSH in the lower right.](06-name-setup.png)

In Bank 1, select a MIDI track and double-tap SRC. Click F at NAME/PUSH.

![Native MIDI TRACK NAME editor containing BASS.](07-name-editor.png)

Enter a default name such as BASS. YES confirms and NO cancels; names can be
up to ten characters.

![Bank 2 pattern B01 showing the name LEAD.](09-bank2-name.png)

In Bank 2, rename that track to LEAD through the same editor. This overrides
only Bank 2, shared across its Parts. Other unedited names still follow Bank 1.

![Bank 1 pattern A01 still showing BASS after the Bank 2 edit.](08-bank1-name.png)

Return to Bank 1 to see BASS unchanged. Stop transport and recorders and wait
for MIDI PROFILE SAVED before switching off. Copy both MIDI3_*.DAT files with
project backups. Native Save As/copy integration remains unqualified.

These are native emulator LCD exports with guarded runtime publication, not
physical photographs. Capture hashes, module/source bindings, panel actions,
renderer and the declared UI tick shim are in capture-names.json. No label or
pixel shape was redrawn. The earlier native-restoration image below is retained
as historical CC documentation; the current site gallery has eight images.

## Open the assignment page

![MIDI CTRL 1 SETUP showing PB and AT as STK, with CC1 7, CC2 1, CC3 2 and CC4 10.](01-native-setup.png)

Select a MIDI track and double-tap FX1 to open CONTROL 1 SETUP. PB and AT show STK here; click encoder A or B to switch that position into CC mode.

## Choose two controllers

![MIDI CTRL 1 SETUP with CC0 in the first position and CC127 in the second position.](02-cc-setup.png)

Click A and B in SETUP to switch both positions into CC mode. Each starts at CC0; this example leaves A at CC0 and turns B to CC127, then confirms with YES. Use controller numbers supported by your receiving instrument.

## Send a value

![MIDI CONTROL 1 on MIDI channel 01 showing CC0 at 64 and CC127 at 32, with the other four CC positions OFF.](03-control-1.png)

Press FX1 to return to CONTROL 1 and enable A or B with FUNC + encoder press. The headers identify CC0 and CC127; their enabled values are 64 and 32 here. Turn the encoder to send a value on the MIDI track’s output channel.

## Read the other assignments

![MIDI CONTROL 2 with controller numbers 71, 72, 73, 74, 75 and 76; all six values are OFF.](04-control-2.png)

Press FX2 to view CONTROL 2. Its headers show the assigned CC numbers, here 71–76, instead of slot names. All six values are OFF in this capture; enable a value before sending it.

## Restore pitch bend

![MIDI CTRL 1 SETUP showing PB as STK in the first position while the second position remains CC127.](05-native-restored.png)

Double-tap FX1 and click A again to restore native pitch bend. PB returns to STK while B keeps CC127, so the modes remain independent. Switching A back to CC later starts at CC0.
